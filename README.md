BetterConsole is an Xcode 4 plugin that makes file paths shown in
Xcode console clickable. This plugin works great with failure
messages generated by [Cedar](http://github.com/pivotal/cedar)
(testing framework).

* Install by building this project

* Restart Xcode

* File paths formatted as `/Full/file/path.ext:123` will be underlined and clickable

(Plugin can be uninstalled by removing `BetterConsole.xcplugin` from
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`)
