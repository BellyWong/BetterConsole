BetterConsole is an Xcode 4 plugin that makes file paths shown in
Xcode console clickable. This plugin works great with failure
messages generated by [Cedar](http://github.com/pivotal/cedar)
(testing framework).

1. Install by building this project

2. Restart Xcode

3. File paths formatted as `/Full/file/path.ext:123` will be underlined and clickable

### Notes

- files are opened in the last focused editor area

- `Option+click` opens files in the adjacent editor area

- Red, green, yellow and cyan
  [ANSI colors](http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/May2004/article335.shtml)
  are respected

(Plugin can be uninstalled by removing `BetterConsole.xcplugin` from
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`)
